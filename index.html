                <h3>The New and Improved School Canteen</h3>
                <p>
                    With new food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.
                     Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices.
                     At Xavier's, each student or staff member who accesses the canteen is provided with a school canteen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have.
                     Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online eliminates all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

                <h3>The Newly Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Accuracy: Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.</li>
                    <li>Economics: Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.</li>
                    <li>Productivity/Efficiency: Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time- consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits, and many more like visibility / insights, hassle free workflow management, flexibility, integration/configuration, real-time tracking, security, and
                        compliance.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>St. Xavier's OAMS
                    informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the student's absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's enrollment number or name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters the selected student's login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at
                    reduced costs.</p>
